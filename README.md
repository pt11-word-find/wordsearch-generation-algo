# wordsearch-generation-algo

This package contains one default export, a function that takes three parameters: (wordlist, width, height)

wordlist - an array of words to be placed in the word search
width / height - integers that indicate the size of the puzzle.

## Planned improvements

- Difficulty - allow a parameter to be passed into the generator to specify difficulty - this will limit the word directions (remove reversed diagonals, remove backwards words)

THIS CAN BE SIMPLIFIED but it works and it's dynamic in sizing
